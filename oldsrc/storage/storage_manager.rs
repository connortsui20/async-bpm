//! This module contains the definition and implementation of both [`StorageManager`] and
//! [`StorageManagerHandle`].
//!
//! The [`StorageManager`] type is intended to be an abstraction around all of the persistent /
//! non-volatile storage that the system has access to.
//!
//! This buffer pool manager is built on the assumption that any storage requests made can be
//! carried out completely in parallel, both in software and in the hardware itself. For example,
//! this buffer pool manager will operate at its best when given access to several NVMe SSDs, all
//! attached via PCIe lanes.
