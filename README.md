# Asynchronous Buffer Pool Manager

An asynchronous buffer pool manager, built on top of `tokio` and `io_uring`.

# Design

This model is aimed at a thread-per-core model with multiple persistent storage drives.
This implies that tasks (coroutines) given to worker threads cannot be moved between threads
(or in other words, are `!Send`).
So it is on a global scheduler to assign tasks to worker threads appropriately.
Once a task has been given to a worker thread, the asynchronous runtime's
scheduler is in charge of managing the cooperative tasks.

An implication of the above is that this model will not work with
`tokio`'s work-stealing multi-threaded runtime.
However, the benefits of parallelism in this model at the cost of
having to manually manage load balancing is likely worth it.
Additionally, a DBMS that could theoretically use this model would likely have
better knowledge of how to schedule things appropriately.

Finally, this is heavily inspired by
[this Leanstore paper](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2090-haas.pdf),
and future work could introduce the all-to-all model of threads to distinct SSDs,
where each worker thread has a dedicated `io_uring` instance for every physical SSD.

# Objects and Types

## Thread Locals

-   `PageHandle`: A shared pointer to a `Page` (through an `Arc`)
-   Local `io_uring` instances (that are `!Send`)
-   Futures stored in a local hash table defining the lifecycle of an `io_uring` event (private)

### Local Daemons

These thread-local daemons exist as foreground tasks, just like any other task the DBMS might have.

-   Listener: Dedicated to polling local `io_uring` completion events
-   Submitter: Dedicated to submitting `io_uring` submission entries
-   Evictor: Dedicated to cooling `Hot` pages and evicting `Cool` pages

## Shared Objects

-   Shared pre-registered buffers / frames
    -   Frames are owned types (can only belong to a specific `Page`)
    -   Frames also have pointers back to their parent `Page`s
    -   _Will have to register multiple sets, as you can only register 1024 frames at a time_
-   Shared multi-producer multi-consumer channel of frames
-   `Page`: A hybrid-latched (read-write locked for now) page header
    -   State is either `Unloaded`, `Loading` (private), or `Loaded`
        -   `Unloaded` implies that the data is not in memory
        -   `Loading` implies that the data is being loaded from persistent storage, and contains a future (private)
        -   `Loaded` implies the data is on one of the pre-registered buffers, and owns a registered buffer
    -   `Page`s also have eviction state
        -   `Hot` implies that this is a frequently-accessed page
        -   `Cool` implies that it is not frequently accessed, and might be evicted soon

Note that the eviction state is really just an optimization for making a decision on pages to evict.
The page eviction state _does not_ imply anything about the state of a page
(so a page could be `Hot` and also `Unloaded`), and all accesses to a page must still go through the hybrid latch.

In summary, the possible states that the `Page` can be in is:

-   `Loaded` and `Hot` (frequently accessed)
-   `Loaded` and `Cool` (potential candidate for eviction)
-   `Loading` (`Hot`/`Cold` plus private `io_uring` event state)
-   `Unloaded` (`Cold`)

# Algorithms

**TODO** this section needs to be updated.

### Write Access Algorithm

Let P1 be the page we want to get write access for.

-   Set eviction state to `Hot`
-   Write-lock P1
-   If `Loaded` (SEMI-HOT PATH):
    -   Modify the page data
    -   Unlock and return
-   Else `Unloaded`, and we need to load the page
    -   Load a page via the [load algorithm](#load-algorithm)
    -   Modify the page data
    -   Unlock and return

### Read Access Algorithm

Let P1 be the page we want to get read access for.
All optimistic reads have to be done through a read closure (cannot construct a reference `&`).

-   Set eviction state to `Hot`
-   Optimistically read P1
-   If `Loaded` (HOT PATH):
    -   Read the page data optimistically and return
    -   If the optimistic read fails, fallback to a pessimistic read
        -   If still `Loaded` (SEMI-HOT PATH):
            -   Read normally and return
        -   Else it is now `Unloaded`, so continue
-   The state is `Unloaded`, and we need to load a page
    -   Upgrade the read lock into a write lock (either drop and retake, or directly upgrade)
    -   Load a page via the [load algorithm](#load-algorithm)
    -   Read the page data
    -   Unlock and return

### Load algorithm

Let P1 be the page we want to load from persistent storage into memory. The caller must have the write lock on P1.
Once this algorithm is complete, the page is guaranteed to be loaded into the owned frame,
and the page eviction state will be `Hot`.

-   If the page is `Loaded`, then immediately return
-   Otherwise, this page is `Unloaded`
-   `await` a free frame from the global channel of frames
-   Set the frame's parent pointer to P1
-   Read P1's data from persistent storage into the buffer
-   `await` read completion from the local `io_uring` instance
-   At the end, set the page eviction state to `Hot`

### General Eviction Algorithm

On every worker thread, there should be at least 1 "background" task
(not scheduled by the global scheduler) dedicated to evicting pages.
It will aim to have some certain threshold of free pages in the free list.

-   Iterate over all frames
-   Collect the list of `Page`s that are `Loaded` (should not be more than the number of frames)
-   For every `Page` that is `Hot`, change to `Cool`
-   Collect all `Cool` pages
-   Randomly choose some (small) constant number of pages from the list of initially `Cool` pages
-   `join!` the following page eviction futures:
    -   For each page Px we want to evict:
        -   Check if Px has been changed to `Hot`, and if so, return early
        -   Write-lock Px
        -   If Px is now either `Hot` or `Unloaded`, unlock and return early
        -   Write Px's buffer data out to persistent storage via the local `io_uring` instance
        -   `await` write completion from the local `io_uring` instance
        -   Set Px to `Unloaded`
        -   Send Px's frame to the global channel of free frames
        -   Unlock Px
